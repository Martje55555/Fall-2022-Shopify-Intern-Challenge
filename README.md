# Fall 2022 - Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question

## Pre-reqs:
This challenge was tackled using Node.js and Postgres, for the backend, and React.js for the front-end.

### Steps:
* Clone the repository [Link](https://github.com/Martje55555/Fall-2022-Shopify-Intern-Challenge)

### Setup Postgres

* Download Postgres 
    * [MacOS](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/)
    * [Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

**Note** - For most systems, the default Postgres user is `postgres`.

In the `postgres_setup` folder you will find a file with the queries needed to create the database structure. Such as, the schema, and the required tables. You can run postgres queries and view your tables via the command line, or with a GUI. I use [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) to better visualize things and make navigating the database easier.
